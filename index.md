Marko Vukolic (Protocol Labs)

# Schedule

- Submission deadline: July 28, 2022
- Author notification: September 1, 2022
- Conference: Oct 31 -- Nov 2, 2022
- **Other affiliated events:**
    - **CESC Hackathon**
    - **GameFi Day**


# Topic of Interest

- **Crypto Economics:** studies that explore and address the economic aspects of  blockchain and Web3 technology, such as (i) economic and monetary aspects of cryptocurrencies, (ii) design and evaluation of incentive mechanisms (e.g., mining economics, staking economics, transaction fee market,  etc.), (iii) economics of security and privacy, (iv) systemic risk and resilience in cryptocurrency and decentralized finance systems.

- **Security and Privacy:** studies and proposals for addressing security and privacy issues in blockchain and Web3 technology, such as (i) attacks to consensus mechanisms or protocol designs, (ii) smart contract vulnerabilities and attacks, smart contract security analysis and defense tools;  (iii) user privacy leakage and defense; (iv) privacy technologies in blockchain and Web3.

- **Scalability:** novel proposals and solutions to improve or evaluate the existing Web3 or blockchain architecture scalability, including (i) layer1, layer2, off-chain scaling, (ii) efficient consensus protocols, or (iii) improvements in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocols, or (iv) real-world measurements for scaling.

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** theoretical, empirical, qualitative, or quantitative research that advances the understanding in areas including (i) DeFi’s composability, and it’s security and economic implications, (ii) miner extractable value, (iii) manipulation resilience of stablecoins, (iv) fair ordering of financial transactions, (v) DeFi user studies, or (vi) design and evaluation of DeFi primitives and protocols.

- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and Decentralized Governance:** studies that shed light on the current state of the DAO ecosystem; novel theories, models, and solutions to enable more efficient and secure decentralized decision-making.

- **Decentralized Identity and Data Sovereignty:** new designs or evaluations for (i) decentralized identity solutions, (ii) decentralized access control solutions, or (iii) policy-compliant decentralized computation.

- <ins>Other Web3 or blockchain related topics:</ins> The above is by no means an exhaustive list of topics we accept. Other topics in blockchain and Web3 including interdisciplinary studies, such as societal impact on decentralization technologies, decentralized intelligence, responsible innovation, etc., are also encouraged.

# Paper Submission Instructions

<ins>Submission Types:</ins>

- Technical Paper: A detailed technical proposal that describes a novel contribution to the theory or practice of blockchain or Web3. (min 6 pages, reviewers will only read first 10 pages)

- Work In Progress: Early-stage innovative ideas or arguable opinions and positions (as a position paper), which could lead to productive community discussions that shed light in future directions. (Please prefix the title with WIP, max 6 pages)

- Systematization of Knowledge: SoK papers evaluate, systemitize, and contextualize existing knowledge, which provides a high value to our community. (Please prefix the title with SOK, min 6 pages, reviewers will only read first 10 pages)

<ins>Proceedings and Submission at other Conferences:</ins> CESC is not archival and does not have proceedings. It is allowed to submit work which has been published at or concurrently submitted to another conference or a journal.

<ins>Anonymous Submission (Optional):</ins> Papers can **optionally** be anonymized. If the authors choose to be anonymized, then no author names or affiliations should appear on the title page, and the submission should not disclose the authors' identities in the document.

<ins>Conflict of Interest:</ins> If you have any conflict of interest with a member of the program committee, please note it in the designated section of the HotCRP submission form.
